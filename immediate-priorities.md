# BerseMuka Immediate Priorities

Based on analysis of requirements vs current implementation and user feedback.

## High Priority (Critical UI/UX Fixes)
1. **Fix home page to match Figma design** - make points sections more interactive
2. **Fix profile section functionality** - ensure profile works properly
3. **Remove top left menu bar** - clean up navigation
4. **Remove 'mobile' visuals from UI** - clean up mobile indicators
5. **Fix bottom navigation bar functionality** - ensure nav works properly

## Medium Priority (Core Functionality)
6. **Clarify if BerseConnect should redirect to events page** - confirm user flow
7. **Add fake data to test events listing functionality** - populate with test data
8. **Build event creation interface for admin/mod roles** - enable event management
9. **Implement QR code scanning functionality for event check-ins** - verify attendance
10. **Add file upload system for profile pictures and event images** - media support
11. **Build Admin Web Dashboard with user management, event tracking, and analytics** - admin tools

## Low Priority (Secondary Features)
12. **Test BerseMatch with fake data** - lower priority since events are primary discovery method

## Key Insights from Analysis
- **Current Status**: ~75% complete
- **Primary User Flow**: Event-based discovery (not BerseMatch)
- **Backend**: Solid with comprehensive APIs
- **Frontend**: Needs UI fixes and some missing features
- **Critical Gap**: Admin dashboard for community management

## Focus Strategy
Since users discover each other through events, prioritize event functionality and UI polish over matching features.
