# Berse App - Complete User Journey Documentation

## Executive Summary
Berse is a trust-based social platform that connects people through physical events, travel, and community engagement. The core differentiator is the **Trust Chain** mechanism - a quality-over-quantity approach to building credible social connections.

## Core Value Proposition

### Primary USP: Trust Chain Mechanism
**"Quality of Trust, Not Quantity"**

Unlike traditional social platforms with unlimited connections:
- **Limited to 3 vouches** from trusted individuals
- **Maximum 2 community** affiliations
- **Accountability system** where voucher's reputation affects yours
- **Trust Moments** (unlimited) - like Google reviews from event interactions
